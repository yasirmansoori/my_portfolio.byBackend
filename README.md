# Welcome to my personal portfolio, which I created and customised using the Bootstrap CSS framework and essential web development languages like as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
# This project is currently served using backed technology Node.js + Express.js framework
# To make it more creative, I used elements from open-source CSS libraries such as animate.io, uiverse.io, and others.
# Also, kudos to Ramsay, the template designer.
# Currently hosted on Render.com (https://my-portfolio-jpne.onrender.com)
